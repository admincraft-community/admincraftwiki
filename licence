## Important Notice About "Your Content"

### Definition of Original Content
To be clear about what constitutes "your content" under this license:

- "Your content" refers ONLY to substantial original work that you have created entirely yourself
- Making minor edits, small changes, or formatting adjustments to existing content does NOT make it "your content"
- Translating existing content does NOT make it "your content"

### Examples of what is NOT "your content":
- Making minor edits to existing guides
- Reformatting or restructuring existing content
- Adding a few lines to an existing guide
- Fixing typos or errors
- Updating outdated information
- Adding small sections to existing content
- Translating existing content to another language

### Examples of what IS "your content":
- Writing a completely new guide from scratch
- Creating entirely new documentation on an undocumented topic
- Writing substantial new sections that stand on their own
- Creating original diagrams or technical illustrations
- Writing original tutorials or how-to guides

The intent of this clarification is to ensure that contributors understand they cannot claim rights to existing content by making minor modifications. Only substantial, original contributions qualify as "your content" under this license.
